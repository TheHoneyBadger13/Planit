# Planit
Repo for the technical assessment 

If you want to run the script on your own machine(provided you have node js installed in your machine):
1. clone the repo 
2. run "npm i" on terminal
3. run "npx cypress open"
4. select the spec file

Note:

1. Reports folder contains the screenshot for the jenkin pipeline that I intergrated the cypress test with
2. Videos folder contains the recording for the test run in cypress
